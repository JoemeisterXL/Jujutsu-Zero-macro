Jujutsu Zero: Auto-Raid Macro
An efficient standalone macro tool for the Jogo Raid in Jujutsu Zero (Roblox). This tool automates the "One-Tap" farming process to maximize your efficiency.

📋 Requirements & Compatibility
The macro is designed to work on any raid difficulty, provided your stats are high enough to finish the fight instantly.

Raid Tiers: Works on all stages (as long as you can One-Tap the boss).

Characters: You must use either Sukuna or Jogo.

Skill: Your Final Attack must be unlocked.

Slot: The character MUST be placed in the 1st slot.

Power: If the boss survives the first hit, the macro loop will break.

Display: Use Full Screen mode for the best results.

🚀 How to Use

Run: Launch the raid.exe (no installation required).

Enter Raid: Start any Jogo Raid (any difficulty.)

Controls:

Press F1 to Start the automation.

Press F2 to Stop and exit the program.

💡 Build Optimization Tips
Since the macro relies on a "One-Tap" kill, focus on these stats to ensure it works on higher difficulties:

Stats: Max out Offense and Sorcery to boost your Crit Damage.

Gear: Obtain the Dragon Bone to significantly increase your Crit Chance.
