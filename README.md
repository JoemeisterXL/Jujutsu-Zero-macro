## 💡 Build Optimization Tips

Since the macro relies on a **One-Tap** kill, focus on these stats to ensure it works on higher difficulties:

* **Stats:** Max out **Offense** and **Sorcery** to boost your **Crit Damage**.
* **Gear:** Obtain the **Dragon Bone** to significantly increase your **Crit Chance**.
